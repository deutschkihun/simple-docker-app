### About Dockerfile & Dockerfile.dev

1. Dockerfile.dev

   - stands for Dockerfile for development mode.
   - contains baseImage : alpine
   - first copy package.json (for getting only necessarily dependencies)
   - and then npm install (install only necessarily dependencies)
   - copy ./ ./ mean copy other files.
   - after finish work -> compile "npm run start"
   - ENV CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true is only for window os (mac doesn't need it)

2. Dockerfile

   - stands for Dockerfile for production and deployment mode
   - First part(first from) is build stage and second part(second from) is run stage
   - this mode is different from development mode so it needs nginx !!
